This is a basic password checker built using python to see and using the Python Regex library in order
to use it to check if the input passwords contain specific characters.

Aside from meeting the requirements for this small project, i designed so it would be using vanilla Python. I wanted to make it easier to understand, therefore i added 
comments on several parts to it that will help with anyone wanting to look at the code. 

I used Regex in order to test the passwords along with some other validation (comparing the password to a list of characters)

Definitely could be more DRY and there are a bit of places where things can be improved. There are places where functional Python programming would be ideal. 
Would love to hear feedback from more experienced engineers to see what they have to say!

Cheers!
